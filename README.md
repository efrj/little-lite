# Little Lite MVC Example
A simple example of MVC application written in PHP without framework. 

It is always good to code for fun! 

## Instructions
This application does not use database.
The sample data is retrieved from a sample json file provided by [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The layout model used in this example was removed from the site [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
The model used was the [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/).

The sample images were taken from the [Loren Flicker](http://loremflickr.com).

Signed as before, this example is very simple and does not use singleton, factory or namespace.

I am designing a mini most advanced framework.

I will be very honored to know that many beginners in PHP may use this example as a case study.
